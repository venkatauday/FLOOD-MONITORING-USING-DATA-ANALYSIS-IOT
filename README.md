Abstract—Flood is one of the most common natural disasters that are causing damages to life and the
country’s economy. This study focuses on Flood monitoring using Data Analysis &amp; Internet of Things
(IoT). This design incorporates certain important elements like Water level flowing in the dam,
humidity, and the water flow based on the rainfall rate. These parameters are closely monitored for
predicting and releasing water from the dam at a moderate rate in advance to avoid flood issues faced by
the public who are living near the dams. The sensor aggregates and collects the data from various
sources that are controlled by the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) from the controller. The sensor
information can be analyzed and the system creates an alert to the public community through the siren
and alert message using a smart communication device. The design of the automated system is to be
optimized for the control of the shutter position. The failure of the opening and closing of gates has
resulted in water scarcity and its wastage. Manual gate results in human errors. Hence this system is
controlled by the machine learning mechanism to follow the servo motors and the electronic control to
monitor the flow of water according to the water level at the given time. Thereafter, the data stored in the
cloud is further used for the prediction. The system can be implemented through mobile/web
applications.
